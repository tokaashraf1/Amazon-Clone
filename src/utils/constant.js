      "I initially purchased this dress on sale. It turned out to be my favorite dress of this summer. It is extremely versatile and unexpectedly flattering. When I accidentally tore it, I was really upset. My husband told me to buy it again, which I typically wouldn't do. It wasn't on sale and I am so frugal. The dress washes very well and I always get compliments when I wear it.",
